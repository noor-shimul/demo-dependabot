MegaLinter is an open-source tool designed to help developers maintain high code quality across a wide range of programming languages, markup formats, and configuration files. It acts as a "linter aggregator", meaning it runs multiple linters and formatters in parallel to check for issues like:

Syntax errors
Code formatting inconsistencies
Security vulnerabilities
Accessibility problems
Best practice violations

Key Features:

Supports 50+ languages and formats (e.g., Python, JavaScript, YAML, Markdown, Dockerfile)
Runs in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
Highly configurable via .mega-linter.yml
Automatic fixes for many issues
Reports in various formats (JSON, SARIF, HTML)

Use Cases:

Enforcing coding standards across teams
Catching issues early in development
Automating code reviews
Improving code readability and maintainability


Customize Terraform linter behavior

to customize TFLint behavior, add a .tflint.hcl file:


config {
  deep_check = true
  ignore_module = false
}

To customize TFLint rules for Terraform, you use the .tflint.hcl configuration file. This file allows you to enable/disable specific rules, configure plugins, and set behavior for how TFLint analyzes your code.

Basic Structure of .tflint.hcl

tflint {
  required_version = ">= 0.50"
}

config {
  format = "compact"
  plugin_dir = "~/.tflint.d/plugins"
  call_module_type = "local"
  ignore_module = {
    "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws" = true
    "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws" = true
  }
  varfile = ["example.tfvars"]
  variables = ["env=prod"]
}

plugin "aws" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.43.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws"
}

rule "aws_instance_invalid_type" {
  enabled = false
}

rule "terraform_naming_convention" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "terraform_unused_declarations" {
  enabled = true
}


What You Can Customize

Enable/Disable Rules: Use rule "<rule_name>" { enabled = true|false }
Plugin Configuration: Specify provider-specific plugins like AWS, Azure, GCP
Ignore Modules: Skip linting for specific modules
Variable Injection: Pass variables for evaluation
Output Format: Choose between default, json, compact, sarif, etc.
Module Call Type: Control whether local or remote modules are analyzed


Categories of TFLint Rules
TFLint rules are organized into several categories:


Terraform Language Rules

Syntax validation
Deprecated features
Unused declarations

.tflint.hcl with AWS and Azure Rules

plugin "aws" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.43.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws"
  region  = "eu-west-2"  # London region
}

plugin "azurerm" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.29.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm"
}

# AWS Rules
rule "aws_instance_invalid_type" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "aws_security_group_invalid_protocol" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "aws_lambda_function_deprecated_runtime" {
  enabled = true
}

rule "aws_resource_missing_tags" {

  ignore_module = false
}



Example .tflint.hcl to Enable All Rules (Manually)
Here‚Äôs a template to get started. You‚Äôll need to manually list each rule you want to enable from the AWS, Azure, and GCP rule directories.


plugin "aws" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.43.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws"
  region  = "eu-west-2"
}

plugin "azurerm" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.29.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm"
}

plugin "google" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.5.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-google"
}

# Example AWS rules
rule "aws_instance_invalid_type" { enabled = true }
rule "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" { enabled = true }
rule "aws_lambda_function_deprecated_runtime" { enabled = true }

# Example Azure rules
rule "azurerm_storage_account_sku" { enabled = true }
rule "azurerm_virtual_machine_size" { enabled = true }

# Example GCP rules
rule "google_compute_instance_invalid_machine_type" { enabled = true }
rule "google_storage_bucket_public_access" { enabled = true }

config {
  format = "compact"
  deep_check = true
  ignore_module = false
}

This ruleset focus on possible errors and best practices about Terraform Language.the rules warn against code that might fail when running terraform apply or practices that should be avoided.

https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm

https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm/blob/master/docs/README.md

https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform

These rules warn of possible errors that can occur at terraform apply. Rules marked with Deep are only used when enabling Deep Checking:

https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws/blob/master/docs/rules/README.md


By running TFLint with this ruleset in advance, you can fix the problem before the error occurs in production CI/CD pipelines.

Rules
There are 700+ rules available, see the Rules documentation page for a complete list. Note that not all of them are enabled by default and need to be configured manually (especially rules involving Best Practices).

https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm



When I say "Enabled Azure Rules", I‚Äôm referring to specific TFLint validation checks that are turned on in your .tflint.hcl file for Terraform configurations using Azure.
These rules help ensure your Terraform code follows best practices and avoids common mistakes when provisioning Azure resources.

üîç Examples of Enabled Azure Rules:


azurerm_storage_account_sku
‚úÖ Validates that the storage account SKU is supported and correctly configured.


azurerm_virtual_machine_size
‚úÖ Checks that the VM size you specify is valid for the selected region.


azurerm_resource_group_location
‚úÖ Ensures that the resource group has a valid and supported location.



üîß Why Enable These Rules?

Catch errors early before deploying infrastructure
Improve security and reliability
Enforce consistency across your Terraform codebase


You can find the complete list of available Azure rules for TFLint in the official GitHub repository:

In your .mega-linter.yml file, the line:
YAML

extends: default


means that your configuration inherits the default MegaLinter settings.
üîç What It Does:

It loads the default flavor, which includes a broad set of linters for many languages and formats.
You can then override or customize specific parts of the configuration (like enabling only TERRAFORM_TFLINT, setting filters, or changing reporters).

üß© Example Use Case:
If you want to start from a clean slate and only use Terraform linters, you can omit extends: default and define everything manually. But if you want to keep the default behavior and just tweak a few things, extends: default is a convenient shortcut.

Trivy Does in MegaLinter
Trivy is a security scanner integrated into MegaLinter that checks for:

Vulnerabilities in OS packages and libraries
Misconfigurations in IaC files (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
Secrets like hardcoded passwords or API keys
License issues in dependencies [megalinter.io]


MegaLinter with Trivy to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in Terraform and other configuration files, follow this setup:



What You‚Äôll Get

Trivy will scan your Terraform and config files for misconfigurations like:

Missing tags
Insecure resource definitions
Unrestricted access policies


Reports will be generated in Markdown, JSON, and SARIF formats


Here are the files you need to run MegaLinter with Trivy to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in Terraform and config files:

üìÑ .mega-linter.yml ‚Äî configures MegaLinter to use Trivy with specific scanners and severity levels.
üìÑ trivy.yaml ‚Äî customizes Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and secrets.

‚úÖ Next Steps:

Place both files at the root of your repository.
Push to GitHub and check the Actions tab for the MegaLinter workflow.
Review the reports for any security issues or misconfigurations.

Here is your fully customized trivy.yaml file with all configurable options enabled for scanning vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, secrets, and license issues:
üìÑ Download trivy.yaml
It includes:

All severity levels
All scanner types (vuln, misconfig, secret, license)

steps:
  - name: Checkout Code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0


Explanation:


steps:
This defines a sequence of actions to be performed in the workflow.


- name: Checkout Code
This is a human-readable name for the step. It helps identify what the step is doing.


uses: actions/checkout@v3
This tells GitHub Actions to use the official checkout action (version 3). This action checks out your repository's code so that subsequent steps can access it.


with:
This section provides input parameters to the checkout action.


fetch-depth: 0
This is a key configuration. By default, checkout fetches only the latest commit (fetch-depth: 1). Setting it to 0 fetches the entire Git history, which is useful if you need access to previous commits (e.g., for generating changelogs, running git log, or using Git tags).
